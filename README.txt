There are two Java programming assignments from the course Operating Systems and the course Data Structures. The first one implements a simulation of tunnels and vehicles using Java Threads, synchronized methods, and condition variables. Detailed Introduction to the assignment can be seen in "PA2.pdf". The second assignment is a interesting project which implements a Chess Leaderboards with AVL trees. Detailed Introduction to the assignment can be seen in "PA2Assignment.pdf". I got full credits for both assignments.

Both assignments were written in the environment of Eclipse IDE. So it is highly recommended to import the "pa2.zip" (Operating Systems) and "yichengtao-PA2.zip" (Data Structures) into Eclipse to run the program. You can also unzip the "pa2.zip" and then find the source codes in the folders ".\pa2\src\main\java\cs131\pa2\CarsTunnels" (mostly written by me), ".\pa2\src\main\java\cs131\pa2\Abstract" (partly written by me in Vehicle.java and Tunnel.java), and ".\pa2\src\test\java\cs131\pa2" (provided tests). Similarly, you can unzip the "yichengtao-PA2.zip" and find the source codes in the folder ".\PA2_AVLTrees\src" (mostly written by me).
